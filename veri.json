        "question": "How Does Veri Work?",
        "answer": "There’s been an explosion of interest in glucose monitoring for non-diabetics in the past two years. And there’s a good reason: 93% of Americans are metabolically unhealthy, and the numbers aren’t much better for the rest of the world [1].\nBut only 10% of that unhealthy population is considered type 2 diabetic [2].\nThat’s because metabolic health is a spectrum, not a binary between diabetic and non-diabetic. And it’s hard to understand where you are on that spectrum and how to improve.\nWe live in a food environment corrupted by corporations pushing disease-causing, addictive products, and a health environment focused on treating the sick.\nWe’ve been pushed pills rather than prevention and buried in an avalanche of one-size-fits-all advice.\nMore and more people are realizing that by tapping into their blood sugar, understanding where they are on the metabolic health spectrum, and making diet and lifestyle changes based on their glucose response, they can take back control of their metabolic health.\nThe best part? It relies on their unique biological data — not an opinion from someone else or an average data point on a chart.\nWhether it’s extending healthspan, reversing insulin resistance, or losing weight, the underlying principle is understanding how to effectively stabilize your blood sugar in a healthy, sustainable way.\nBut a CGM alone is often an unreliable tool because the raw data lacks meaning, insights, and guidance.\nThat’s why we created the Veri Method.\nWhat Is the Veri Method?\nResearch shows that the four most powerful levers you can pull for metabolic health are food, exercise, sleep, and stress, so everything we do in the Veri app is designed around making improvements in those areas.\nThey are your metabolic habits.\nVeri shows you which are serving your body and which aren’t, then guides you to build lasting habits that will compound over time into better metabolic health.\nThink of it like a feedback loop.\nFor example: you eat something, see exactly how that meal impacted your blood sugar, and we guide you to make small adjustments to improve the next time. It’s a positive loop of continuous learning and improvement.\nBy focusing on your metabolic habits rather than vague outcomes, you can make small changes every day that produce big results.\nThe Veri app can be broken into four parts, each designed to keep your positive feedback loop going:\nTracking\nScoring\nGuidance\nOutcomes\nTracking\nWhether it’s what you eat, how you sleep, or when you work out, you need a simple way of tracking your habits so they can be analyzed against your glucose response.\nFor some, the word “tracking” immediately turns their stomach because they think of all the hours they’ve spent counting calories.\nAnd we see you.\nThat’s why we’ve prioritized ease and automation so you can spend less time tracking, and more time doing.\nLogging your food is simple with smart suggestions from almost 1 million foods, and you can easily add your favorite meals with one tap — or set a routine to add your go-to breakfast every day automatically.\nWhile most people think about food when they think of blood sugar, your sleep and exercise play a key role in your metabolic health. The same food can have an entirely different effect depending on how well you’ve slept, when you exercise, and if you’re stressed.\nVeri automatically imports your sleep and exercise data from Apple Health or Google Fit so you can build better habits without the hassle.\nIf weight loss is a goal, you can easily add your weight or sync it from Apple Health or Google Fit.\nScoring\nAt the core of the Veri app are two features that turn simple glucose data into meaningful, actionable metrics: Meal Scores and Daily Scores.\nThe Meal Score brings together evidence-based glucose measures to rate your meal from 1 to 10. The score integrates glucose fluctuation, glucose rise, time above your ideal range, and after-meal average glucose level [3-6].\nA higher score reflects a meal with a more stable glucose response. A lower score reflects a meal that has a less stable glucose response.\nThe result?\nYou’ll understand exactly what foods work for your body and which don’t without having to dig into the raw data. No more depending on general advice or hot diet trend.\nYour Daily Score is your day-to-day lifestyle coach. It keeps you on track and accountable to the metabolic habits that are proven to have the biggest impact on your metabolic health.\nEvery week you’ll get a report showing where you’ve done well, and where you can improve.\nGuidance\nFirst-time users of CGMs not using Veri will often feel a little lost with all the data.\nThat’s why we developed “My Journey,” which takes the guesswork out of improving your metabolic health through guided learning paths.\nYou’ll learn the key concepts behind metabolic health, how to apply them, and how to use Veri to achieve your goals.\nYou’ll also have access to our private community directly through the app where users exchange ideas, success stories, and recipes.\nOutcomes\nWe said at the top that most people don’t know where they are on the spectrum of metabolic health.\nWe decided to end that problem.\nMetabolic Healthspan is the period of your life spent in good metabolic health.\nIt’s your way of understanding exactly how the diet, exercise, and lifestyle changes you’re making add up to improved health outcomes.\nMetabolic Healthspan was co-developed with Veri’s advisors of researchers, endocrinologists, and cardiologists from universities like Stanford and Harvard and institutions such as the American Diabetes Association (ADA) and Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC).\nOur metric integrates five evidence-based metrics shown to have the biggest impact on your healthspan — average glucose, morning fasting glucose, glucose variability, glucose oscillation, and body mass index (BMI) [7-10].\nRather than depending on a yearly A1C test that only shows you your average glucose, Metabolic Healthspan shows you exactly where you are on the spectrum of metabolic health so you can take back control of your well-being.\nKey Takeaways\nWhether your goal is to lose weight, reverse insulin resistance, or extend your healthy years, stabilizing your blood sugar is critical.\nVeri’s unique approach combines the glucose data of a CGM with insights and guidance that empower you to achieve stable blood sugar levels and take back your metabolic health."

        "question": "What is Metabolic Health?",
        "answer": "You’ve probably heard someone credit their “fast metabolism” for their body composition before. And while metabolism may be a factor in weight management, that doesn’t paint a full picture of what metabolism actually is.\nMetabolism is about much more than weight control or how much food you can eat. It’s a vital process that helps power all of our bodily functions. Learn more about this process and the importance of supporting your metabolic health, below.\nWhat is metabolism?\nTo put it simply, human metabolism equals all the chemical reactions that take part in transforming food into energy and building blocks for our bodies. The energy and building blocks are then used for three important actions:\nDestroy old cells\nMaintain living cells\nProduce new cells\nWhat does a healthy metabolism look like?\nIn a healthy state, the human body is a very smart machine that has a lot of flexibility when it comes to metabolism. A healthy metabolism is very much about efficient fuel utilization (aka how we process food).\nMetabolic health is measured by checking levels of:\nFasting blood sugar\nCholesterol: triglycerides & high-density lipoproteins (HDL)\nBlood pressure\nWaist circumference\nWhen everything is working optimally, the body is adaptable and capable of:\nUtilizing different types of food for fuel \nSurviving when there is a lack of fuel from not eating enough\nHandling excess fuel when we eat too much\nThis is also referred to as metabolic flexibility. Unfortunately, only an estimated 12% of Americans are metabolically healthy and flexible.[1] This means a majority of the population is living with metabolic dysfunction. \nWhat is metabolic dysfunction?\nMetabolic inflexibility or metabolic dysfunction means that our bodies have trouble handling, circulating, and storing the fuel that we feed to it.[2]\nIt’s linked to an increased risk of various chronic diseases, including: \nType 2 diabetes\nMetabolic syndrome\nHeart disease\nStroke\nCancer.\nThe earlier you catch the signs of metabolic problems the better as these diseases take years, even decades, to develop. \nSigns of metabolic dysfunction include:\nExcess fat around your abdomen\nElevated blood glucose (blood sugar) levels\nElevated “bad” cholesterol \nAnd taking care of your metabolic health is not only about preventing disease. Your current state of metabolic flexibility can have a huge impact on your everyday life. Losing your metabolic flexibility has been associated with depressive symptoms, skin problems like psoriasis and acne, and hair loss.[3,4]‍\nSo, where do we start? One of the best ways to measure your metabolic health doesn’t require a doctor’s visit—it’s something you can do at home, every day: monitoring your blood sugar.\nBlood sugar and metabolic health\nMonitoring blood sugar levels more closely, especially after a meal, can give some very early warning signs that there is something going on with your metabolism.\nIt is normal for your blood sugar to rise after a meal, but if it stays elevated for an extended period of time, it’s often an indicator that the body has trouble regulating its sugar metabolism.\nBig fluctuations of blood sugar increase the risk of developing further metabolic problems. High, post-meal blood sugar spikes have been associated with higher risk for heart disease and cancer, especially if they happen repeatedly.[5,6] The metabolic stress caused by large swings in blood sugar can also have a long term effect on your cognition, the capacity to remember and learn new things.[7]\nBenefits of stable blood sugar\nIn a healthy state, even very high blood sugar spikes are brought down rapidly thanks to a well-running metabolism. But having constant spikes might not be so good for your long-term health. These swings between low and high can also affect your day-to-day life, even when you would be considered metabolically healthy. Monitoring your lifestyle and reducing blood sugar spikes can therefore improve your day-to-day experience.\nHere are some scientifically backed benefits of stable blood sugar:\nImproved skin health (fewer/delayed wrinkles, acne control)[8,9]\nMore energy and focus[10,11]\nImproved cognitive function[12,13]\nThat said, stable blood sugar within a metabolically healthy range is something we should all strive for. But how do we know if we’re actually there—especially when we’re probably only used to having our blood sugar tested at our annual physical? \nThis is where the Veri continuous glucose monitoring (CGM) system steps in. Our wearable device checks your blood sugar throughout the day and connects to an app, which empowers you to take your wellbeing into your own hands. You’ll get real-time data on how your food and lifestyle habits affect your metabolic health, and with those insights, you can make changes to feel your very best."

        "question": "What is the Surprising Connection Between Your Heart and Metabolic Health?",
        "answer": "When we talk about our metabolic health and the progression of metabolic conditions, we often mention things like “high risk of cardiovascular disease” or “increased cardiometabolic risk.”\nBut what is cardiometabolic health? And what’s the connection between glucose, insulin, and heart health? \nThis heart health month, we’re breaking down the surprising connection between metabolic health and heart health and explaining how you can leverage Veri’s 4 pillars to improve your heart health. Stay tuned for our weekly installments on all things heart and metabolic health.\nWhat Is Cardiometabolic Health?\nMetabolic health refers to a cluster of symptoms that can cause poor health and increase your risk for chronic disease. These symptoms are high cholesterol, high fasting blood glucose, a large waistline, and high blood pressure. \nWhen talking about cardiometabolic health, we’re talking about the exact same set of symptoms, but specifically, how they impact your heart and its functioning. \nNo matter which word we use, the risk of heart problems, diabetes, weight gain, and chronic disease are the same, and the same set of factors (like poor glucose control and insulin resistance) is a large part of the problem. \nThe good news is that practicing healthy habits around what you eat, how and when you exercise, stress management, and quality sleep can protect your metabolic health — and, more specifically, your heart. \nManaging glucose levels can help reverse insulin resistance, support weight loss, help prevent future chronic diseases like diabetes, and protects your heart. By balancing your glucose levels and applying the same habits you do to take care of your metabolic health, you take care of your heart health as well.\nGlucose and Heart Health\nIf you’ve used the Veri app or are generally curious about metabolic health, you’ve likely heard that blood sugar spikes after meals are problematic because they can lead to insulin resistance. \nThis is true, but high blood glucose — whether it's post-meal spikes or high fasting glucose — can substantially affect your vascular system if not managed. The vascular system refers to your veins, arteries, and heart, which move blood throughout the body. Damage to the vascular system can lead to damage to your major organ systems. \nBut how do glucose levels cause vascular damage? Over time, repeated instances of high blood sugar, or sustained high blood sugar, can decrease the elasticity of blood vessels [1]. When elasticity decreases, blood vessels become stiffer, which makes it more difficult for blood to pass through them. This forces the heart to work harder, and over time can cause problems like heart attack and heart failure [2, 3]. \nStudies show that high glucose levels and variability in non-diabetic people are risk factors of cardiovascular disease [4, 5]. One study found that in non-diabetics, higher (but still normal) fasting glucose levels are associated with an 83% increase in heart failure [6]. \nThe connection between glucose and heart health is clear, and managing glucose levels can reduce your risk of cardiac events. But where does insulin fit into the picture? \nInsulin and Heart Health\nInsulin, the hormone that regulates blood glucose, is tied to heart health, though less directly than high glucose. \nOne study showed that high levels of insulin were only slightly associated with heart health, but in large part, this was explained by obesity, high blood pressure, and high cholesterol existing at the same time [7].\nIn other words, insulin resistance on its own is not causing heart issues, but rather, it’s insulin resistance combined with problems like being overweight, high blood pressure, and high cholesterol that cause poor heart health.\nAnother study looked at experiments done on insulin resistance and sugar intake using glucose tolerance tests and found a strong relationship between intake of high fructose corn syrup and related refined carbs, elevated insulin levels, and poor heart health [8]. The researchers suggested that intake of refined carbs affected heart health by first increasing insulin levels, illustrating how both food choice and insulin resistance can harm your heart. \nKey Takeaways\nThe more you know about health, the more it can seem like so much to manage. But the good news is that by managing your metabolic health through glucose monitoring, good nutrition, regular exercise, quality sleep, and managing stress, you’re protecting your heart health as well. \n“Cardiometabolic health” and “metabolic health” are interchangeable terms that are categorized by the same set of clinical symptoms. \nHigh glucose variability and high fasting glucose levels can affect the vascular system, which ultimately can harm your heart. \nHigh circulating insulin is not a direct cause of poor heart health but is inextricably linked to things like obesity, high glucose levels, and high blood pressure levels that cause poor heart health. \nBy practicing healthy habits around food, exercise, sleep, and stress, you can work to reverse insulin resistance, decrease the risk of future chronic conditions, and protect your heart health. \nStay tuned for upcoming heart health month posts, where we’ll do deep dives on nutrition, sleep, and stress as they affect metabolic health and the health of your heart."
